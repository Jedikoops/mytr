        <h1>Computer Science is not about Science</h1>

        <p>Hey, bucketuber here. Todays video is going to be an introspective one.
        
        I've been thinking a lot recently and there is a problem. my thoughts have been getting too deep.

        Sometimes when I'm really hard at thinking, people around me look at me like im constipated. WHICH. I. AM. NOT.

        Now listen, I am living a cautionary tale of what NOT to do.

        This might be upsetting to some of you, BUTT your favourite bucketuber has a few words of wisdom to share with you all.

        Sometimes when life is not ROFL XD and it's more of a :0 and you think the world is ending, nuh uh uh. 
        
        The world moves on and the world moves forward.

        This video is of the upmost importance, "Computer Science, ya it actually don't be doing all that much Science".

        When I thought I was going into compsci we would have to learn the name of a lot of smart tinkers and cool algorythms. 

        compsci majors do learn the cool algorythims like the Red Black Tree but not any of the origins, I would like to know

        what first commanded someone to create these algorthims, when and where they were used and a lot of other real world stories.

        Honestly, this is like my fabourite part, because the other part is problem solving and if your favourite thing is also 

        a problem then you can't fix the problem because then the problem is gone and you will lose your favourite thing. 
        
        Hyperbolic if i do say so my self and I do say so so therefore this statement has been said... boyakasha.

        If I could only understand the reasoning then I will feel more good. 

        I wish there could be more politics and history with computer science, I feel like its too abstracted and ignores the

        human experience that comes with learning how to code. 

        If for every section of a textbook I could also learn about the applications of a problem, then like, i'd be cool around 

        my friends when i yap about school. Think about it, problem solving, the problem has already been solved before you talk about it.

        So the only thing you can talk about relating to school is 1. explain the problem 2. your solution. then you rob them of the chance

        of discovering that problem for themself and the conversation is one sided.

        One thing my Systems programming prof is doing well is contextualizing all of the problems, with some sort of worldbuilding.

        Tho this still upsets me because these aren't actually commisioned by the Carleton Ghost Hunting Society and is all a ploy by

        big education to make me solve and submit silly problems that will then be included with my resume for recruiters to look at.
